I have an integer and a list. I would like to make a new list of them beginning
with the variable and ending with the list.
Writing a + list I get errors. The
compiler handles a as integer, thus I cannot use append, or extend either. 
How
would you do this?

How it works:

array.insert(index, value)

Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the
element before which to insert, so array.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of
the list, and array.insert(len(array), x) is equivalent to
array.append(x).Negative values are treated as being relative to the end of the
array.

Note that if you are trying to do that operation often, especially in loops, a
list is the wrong data structure.

Lists are not optimized for modifications at the front, and somelist.insert(0,
something) is an O(n) operation [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity.]

somelist.pop(0) and del somelist[0] are also O(n) operations.

The correct data structure to use is a deque
[https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.deque] from the
collections module. deques expose an interface that is similar to those of
lists, but are optimized for modifications from both endpoints. They have an
appendleft method for insertions at the front.

Demo:

Another way of doing the same,

You can use Unpack list:

a = 5

li = [1,2,3]

li = [a, *li]

=> [5, 1, 2, 3]

Based on some (minimal) benchmarks using the timeit module it seems that the
following has similar if not better performance than the accepted answer

As with [a] + list this will create a new list and not mutate lst.

If your intention is to mutate the list then use lst.insert(0, a).

[NOTE]:

collections.deque is faster than Python pure list in a loop Relevant-Post
[https://stackoverflow.com/a/23487658/3702377.]

New lists can be made by simply adding lists together.

None of these worked for me. I converted the first element to be part of a
series (a single element series), and converted the second element also to be a
series, and used append function.

make sure that ur_data is of string type
so if u have data= int(5) convert it to
 ur_data = str(data)
